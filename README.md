## Inspiration

In light of the ongoing of pandemic of COVID-19, maintaining a healthy lifestyle
proves to be challenging due to lack of activity and social interaction, causing deterioration
of physican and mental health.

## What it does

Our app, studyBuddies is a web app that is designed to resolve the lack of motivation of students by allowing them to create custom flashcards catered to the topic they are studying.
Once you press "play", you will enter our gamemode that displays the questions on-screen with a textbox to input your answer.

## How we built it

Our application's frontend is built with React and Javascript. The backend of our program uses Firebase as a way to store our bank of questions in realtime. 
## Challenges with ran into

A challenge we ran into was integrating the database with the front-end as we did not have 
any prior experience with databases and connecting it with a front-end application.
Our intentions was to include a backend using Java to calculate points based on how many questions the user answered correctly, however we did not have time to implement it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 

We are proud of the UI of our site and how we were able to connect the database to our frontend.

## What we learned

From this project we learned how to connect a backend database to the frontend of an application. With this in mind, we hope that we will be able to apply this to future 
full-stack projects and hackathons in order to get our projects running more smoothly!
